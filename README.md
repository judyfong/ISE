* glossary should be kept in the individual categories
* hljodfraedi have the titles in both english and icelandic (different pages
* translations) and keep the language titles consistent
    * if possible audio files for each sound

* link to discord

Michael Danner and he TunguPal author of TunguPal, link to the TunguPal Discord server
* make a landing page for TunguPal
* does he want his email as the contact info?

Malfraedi should be done in conjunction with Michael
* malfraedi masculine categories are like 4 but there are a bunch of exceptions
* so the categories don't really teach you anything

* same is true for feminine
